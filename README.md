# CSS Fundamentals - Profile Card

This project is a simple personal profile card built as part of a CSS fundamentals activity. It demonstrates the use of:

- CSS selectors and specificity

- Google Fonts and custom typography

- Colors and backgrounds

- Box model properties (margin, padding, border)

- Layout techniques

- Pseudo-classes and transitions

The card includes a profile image, name, title, bio, skills list, and social media links. All styles are written in pure CSS.
